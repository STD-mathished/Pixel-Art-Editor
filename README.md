Draw with different colors on a pixel grid
Erase pixels
Save your drawing as an image
Clear the canvas to start fresh

The goal of this project was to create a simple and fun tool for creating pixel art while exploring the capabilities of Pygame. It's a fully offline application that can be run from a single Python file — great for learning, experimenting, or relaxing with a bit of retro-style creativity.
